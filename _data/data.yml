    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      From a startup to a corporation, then mid-size businesses. 
      I'm able to adapt to any work environment providing the highest quality programming work.
      I've been developing backend services for years getting to know the best practices, technology stacks, and methodologies.
      Throughout those years I've made myself proficient with the most popular software development approaches, 
      from object-oriented to purely functional, from synchronous to asynchronous and reactive, and from monoliths to microservices and serverless.
      Recently I grew my skillset by adapting Flutter as the frontend solution in my toolbox to get acquainted with all software development areas.
      For my side projects, I had an opportunity to create cloud stacks using AWS as well as creating my own from open-source tools such as ElasticStack and
      Docker Swarm. 
      I am in touch with industry trends and I continuously get involved in researching new technology stacks.
