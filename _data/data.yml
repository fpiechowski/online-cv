career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        With experience spanning startups, corporations, and mid-sized businesses, I adapt to any work environment while delivering top-quality programming solutions. For years, I’ve developed robust backend services, mastering best practices, diverse tech stacks, and methodologies. I’m proficient in a range of software development approaches, from object-oriented to functional programming, synchronous to asynchronous and reactive processes, and monolithic to microservices and serverless architectures.
        Recently, I broadened my skillset by integrating Flutter into my frontend development toolbox, giving me a full-stack perspective across software layers. My side projects have taken me deep into cloud technology, where I built cloud stacks using AWS and open-source tools like ElasticStack and Docker Swarm. In addition, my recent work with Unreal Engine and C++ has strengthened my capabilities in game development and high-performance systems.
        I stay engaged with industry trends, continuously researching new technologies, and I actively participate in cross-team initiatives, sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration. I am driven by a commitment to innovation and adaptable solutions across the software landscape.
